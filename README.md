This is a [project_ai_summarizer](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_ai_summarizer/tree/main) project with [`YouTube`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpvtZZi5ZWk&t=1229s).

I've followting YouTube video, but also implement project with nextjs and typescript.

So, I will be using static page generation for github pages for preview.

Alongside building this application:
- setup a NextJS project using Typescript
- using Tailwind CSS
- make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
- save history using the local storage
- handle form events and catch errors
- implement copy to clipboard
- write clean code
